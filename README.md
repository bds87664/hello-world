I am a college student who genuinely hates college. 
I spend my precious days searching for a way out, but I am a first generation student and I feel a sense of responsibility. 
I love the fashion industry and anything else that encourages my creativity. 
Right now is the best time to proceed with learning a new skill. 
It would allow me to freely pursue my passions, interests, and lifestyle. 
Who wouldn't love that?
